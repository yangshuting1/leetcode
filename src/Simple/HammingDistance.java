/**
 * The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
    Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.
    Note:
         0 ≤ x, y < 231.
    Input: x = 1, y = 4
    Output: 2
    Explanation:
        1   (0 0 0 1)
        4   (0 1 0 0)
